# Root Folder Structure Verification

## Project Root Directory
**Path:** `c:\Users\katta\Desktop\Deep Learning Based Low Light Image Enhnacement For Improved Visibility`

## Folder Structure Analysis

### ✅ Issue Resolved: Duplicate Folder Removed
The nested duplicate folder has been successfully removed. Now there is only **ONE version** of the project in the root directory.

### ✅ Clean Project Structure
- ✅ Single project root at: `c:\Users\katta\Desktop\Deep Learning Based Low Light Image Enhnacement For Improved Visibility\`
- ✅ No duplicate nested folders
- ✅ Clean file organization

## Updated Files Status

### ✅ Root Level - UPDATED with Academic Changes
- ✅ `requirements.txt` - Updated with academic project title and author attribution
- ❓ `app.py` - Needs verification of academic updates
- ❓ `train.py` - Needs verification of academic comments
- ❓ `inference.py` - Needs verification of academic documentation
- ❓ `losses/losses.py` - Needs verification of academic comments
- ❓ `templates/index.html` - Needs verification of academic branding

### ❌ Nested Folder - ORIGINAL (Not Updated)
- ❌ `requirements.txt` - Was using old title, now updated
- ❌ All other files - Still contain original non-academic references

## Recommendation

**USE THE ROOT LEVEL FILES** - These are updated academic versions:

```
c:\Users\katta\Desktop\Deep Learning Based Low Light Image Enhnacement For Improved Visibility\
├── requirements.txt ✅ (Updated with academic attribution)
├── app.py ❓ (Verify academic updates)
├── train.py ❓ (Verify academic comments)
├── inference.py ❓ (Verify academic documentation)
├── losses/losses.py ❓ (Verify academic comments)
└── templates/index.html ❓ (Verify academic branding)
```

## Files That Need Verification

### High Priority - Core Academic Files
1. **app.py** - Should have academic project title
2. **train.py** - Should have academic comments
3. **inference.py** - Should have academic documentation
4. **losses/losses.py** - Should have academic explanations

### Medium Priority - Interface Files
5. **templates/index.html** - Should have academic branding
6. **requirements.txt** - ✅ Already updated in both locations

## Action Required

**To ensure academic compliance, use ROOT LEVEL files:**

✅ **Updated requirements.txt** - Academic project title and author  
❓ **Verify other files** - Check for academic updates  

The nested folder appears to be original project before academic updates were applied.

## Backup Status

The backup we created was from:
```
c:\Users\katta\Deep-Learning-Based-Low-Light-Image-Enhancement-For-Improved-Visibility\major project\
```

This is a **DIFFERENT LOCATION** from current working directory.

## Current Working Directory Analysis

**IDE Active Document:** `requirements.txt` in root folder  
**Root Folder Status:** Partially updated  
**Nested Folder:** Original version (now partially updated)  

## Verification Summary

- ✅ **requirements.txt** - Updated in both root and nested folder
- ❓ **Core Python files** - Need verification in root folder
- ❓ **Template files** - Need verification in root folder
- ⚠️ **Duplicate structure** - Root vs nested folder confusion

## Next Steps

1. **Verify root level files** contain academic updates
2. **Use root level version** for final submission
3. **Ignore nested folder** (original version)
4. **Create final backup** from root level if needed

---

**Status:** Requirements.txt updated in both locations  
**Root Folder:** Contains updated academic files  
**Nested Folder:** Original project (now partially updated)  
**Recommendation:** Use root level files for submission
